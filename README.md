# xpchat

A (sort of) decentralized chat client for Windows XP.

This project is made up of three components:
- A central server that tells the client what chat servers are available, so there can be servers in many different locations and users can host their own servers. 
- A chat server that handles receiving and sending messages between users and ensuring users don't have duplicate names
- A chat client that runs on Windows XP and connects to both the central and chat servers.

This was made as a submission for the Rewind YSWS.
